-All tests should work fine with the exception of "default_names" which

+All tests should work fine with the following exceptions:
+
+- functions/eval: this test may fail when you use ksh as /bin/sh.exe. This seems to be
+  a OS/2 related "feature" of ksh.
+- variables/SHELL: all five tests may fail but this should not affect the functionality
+  of make. Hopefully, this will be fixed before the final release of GNU make 3.81.
